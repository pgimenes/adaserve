The Bird of Hermes is my name

Eating my wings to keep me tame

 

From broken bodies blood is shed

Soon to become ghouls undead

The Bird of Hermes shall come soon

Be it morning, evening, afternoon

The Bird of Hermes feeds on fright

Soon blood shall stain the wicked night

The Bird of Hermes will devour

His enemies in the midnight hour

 

The Bird of Hermes is my name

Eating my wings to keep me tame

 

The night shall soon be stained with red

Your army lies bleeding and dead

Their bodies shall rise soon

And join The Bird's dark platoon

You shall learn to live in night

Obeying ghouls made to fight

The blood shall be a ghastly shower

The Bird's enemies shall run and cower

 

The Bird of Hermes is my name

Eating my wings to keep me tame
